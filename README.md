# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Get the four coordinate values from the user
### Step 2: 
Use import.math to assign the distance formula
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: 
Round the value up to two decimal values and the print values it would be calculated
### Step 5:
End the program

### PROGRAM:

x=4
y=2
x1=10
y1=6
d=math.sqrt((x1-x)**2+(y1-y)**2)
print(f"{d:.2f}")
